                <p>One of our primary advantages is that we deliver food quickly and have a variety of cuisines suitable for students. We've contacted a number of eateries and businesses that provide student discounts. In Vietnam, for example, high school students frequently take supplementary classes. Some of them barely received a thirty-minute lunch break before returning to their lessons. As a result, our service is useful; we provide rapid delivery from local eateries and cafés, as well as a discount for customers who have a student card.</p>
