                <p>My name is Nguyen Cong Thinh and my student ID is s3926387. I was born and raised in Hanoi city. I graduated from Kim Lien High School and I’m currently in my first year of RMIT University. English is the only foreign language I know, for now, I do have a plan to learn Korean right after I graduate from RMIT. I’m not as energetic as everyone I know, I mostly watch films and play video games to kill time, and I have a passion for video games, especially the shooting and battle royale genre and Pokemon games as an exception RPG game. When talking about Information Technology, the very first thing that crosses my mind is Virtual Reality, and Artificial Intelligence, Video Games Developing those are factors making me want to study more about the world of IT. Right now I only have basic Python and HTML knowledge and coding skills, but I want to improve these skills even further and learn more necessary skills in the future and while studying at RMIT. Hopefully enough to ace my future AI-related jobs and develop video games as my hobby.
